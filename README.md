# Data Structures and Algorithms Syllabus Tree Project

This project implements a hierarchical syllabus structure for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The syllabus tree is built using Python’s object-oriented programming principles, with each topic and subtopic represented as nodes in a tree. Additional functionalities include linked resources and questions relevant to each topic, making this a comprehensive and interactive syllabus representation.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around organizing DSA topics into a tree-like structure, where each node represents a topic/module and is capable of storing:
- **Duration in hours** (if available),
- **Resource links** related to the topic,
- **Questions** to practice and test understanding.

### Features:
1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Organized by modules and subtopics, allowing detailed exploration.
2. **Resource Mapping**: Each topic can have additional educational resources.
3. **Interactive Question Bank**: A set of questions associated with each topic for quick review.

## Data Structures Used and Their Purpose

### 1. **Tree Data Structure** (Implemented as `TreeNode` Class)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the hierarchical structure of the syllabus. Each node (topic or subtopic) can have child nodes (subtopics) and associated resources/questions.
   - **Representation**: A `TreeNode` instance for each topic/subtopic, with children pointing to other `TreeNode` instances.

#### Class Structure of `TreeNode`
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, name, hours=None):
        self.name = name           # Name of the module or topic
        self.hours = hours          # Duration in hours (optional)
        self.resources = {}         # Dictionary for additional resources
        self.children = []          # List of child TreeNode instances
        self.questions_map = {}     # Dictionary for storing questions
```
### Key Attributes of `TreeNode`

* `name`: Stores the topic name.
* `hours`: (Optional) Estimated time for each topic, useful for planning study sessions.
* `resources`: Dictionary structure (`HashMap`) where each entry has a key (resource name) and a URL as the value.
* `children`: List data structure to store subtopics as child nodes.
* `questions_map`: Dictionary (topic-specific questions are added under relevant keys).

### Why Use a Tree Structure?

A syllabus naturally follows a hierarchical pattern, and using a tree makes it easy to:

* **Traverse**: Navigate through main topics and their subtopics.
* **Expandability**: Add new modules or topics without disrupting existing structure.
* **Flexibility**: Each topic can have its own resources and questions.

## Key Methods in `TreeNode`

### `add_child(self, child_node)`

Adds a child node to represent a subtopic.

### `add_resource(self, key, url)`

Maps a resource name to a URL, making the resource accessible under the topic node.

### `add_questions(self, topic, questions)`

Links specific questions to the current topic.

### `display_tree(self, level=0)`

Recursively prints out the syllabus structure, displaying topics, resources, and associated questions.

# Data Structures and Algorithms Syllabus Tree

This project represents a hierarchical syllabus for a Data Structures and Algorithms course, organized into modules with topics, resources, and key questions.

## Project Overview

The **Data Structures and Algorithms Syllabus Tree** is structured using a custom Python class `TreeNode`. Each node represents a topic, subtopic, or module in the syllabus, along with resources and questions related to the topic. This structure is recursively built using child nodes to represent a detailed syllabus layout.

## Code Representation and Explanation

### Building the Syllabus Tree

The syllabus tree is created by initializing a root node (`syllabus`) and attaching child nodes for each module and topic. Each module contains subtopics and resources for learning, along with a list of questions to assess understanding.

```python
def build_syllabus_tree():  
    # Root node  
    syllabus = TreeNode("Data Structures and Algorithms Syllabus")  

    # Adding modules as child nodes  
    module1 = TreeNode("Module 1: Algorithm Analysis", 8)  
    module1.add_child(TreeNode("Importance of algorithms and data structures"))  
    # More subtopics added similarly...  

    syllabus.add_child(module1)  # Add other modules similarly  
    return syllabus
```
### Resource and Question Mapping Example
Each topic can have resources and questions associated with it.

```python
asymptotic_analysis = TreeNode("Asymptotic Analysis for Recurrence Relations")
asymptotic_analysis.add_resource("Recurrence Relations Explained", "https://youtu.be/4V30R3I1vLI?si=ofK-lcoxqETjhM3W")
asymptotic_analysis.add_questions("Asymptotic Analysis for Recurrence Relations", [
    "What is the difference between best, worst, and average case analysis?",
    "Explain asymptotic notations like Big O, Omega, and Theta."
])
```
## Additional Features
### Random Question Generation
The generate_n_questions(n) function randomly samples n questions from the dataset, which can be used to test or review topics.

### Sample Code
```python
def generate_n_questions(n):
    questions_dataset = { ... }  # Predefined questions per topic
    all_questions = [q for topic in questions_dataset.values() for q in topic]
    random_questions = random.sample(all_questions, n)
    for i, question in enumerate(random_questions, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {question}")
```
